# Analysis of Expansionary Monetary Policy Effects in Gondwana

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the economic effects of an expansionary monetary policy in Gondwana, focusing on its impact on the manufacturing and financial sectors. The analysis evaluates the feasibility of implementing future expansionary policies based on historical data and sector performance.

## Key Questions Addressed
1. Will expansionary monetary policy positively impact national production?
2. How do productive sectors respond to monetary policy shocks?
3. Should another expansionary policy be implemented?

## Executive Summary
- **Policy Period:** 23rd Oct 2023 â€“ 6th Jan 2024.
- **Key Action:** Reduced interest rates to increase money supply.
- **Sector Performance:** 
  - **Manufacturing Sector:** Significant growth during the policy period, with returns increasing from -0.03 to 0.34 and sustaining higher post-policy levels.
  - **Financial Sector:** Declines due to reduced profit margins and constrained revenue from interest-sensitive activities.

## Key Findings
- **Interest Rate Trends:** Declined significantly during the policy period.
- **Manufacturing Sector Benefits:** 
  - 38% growth during the policy shock.
  - Sustained 6% higher returns post-policy compared to pre-policy levels.
- **Sector Comparison:** 
  - Manufacturing benefited from lower borrowing costs, increased demand, and optimized production.
  - Financial sector faced challenges due to reduced interest-related revenues.

## Visual Insights
- **Scatter Plot:** Strong negative correlation between company returns and interest rates supports the conclusion.
- **Pre-During-Post Analysis Table:** Highlights the manufacturing sector's sustained growth.

## Recommendations
Future expansionary monetary policies should be implemented gradually to:
- Maximize growth in the manufacturing sector.
- Minimize disruptions to the financial sector.
